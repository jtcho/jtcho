I've wanted to rebuild my website for a really long time. 
It's gone through several iterations in the past – some more tacky than the others.
I started off wanting to use the opportunity to learn lots of interesting new web frameworks, like Angular/React. 
Turns out, this is a poor choice for a personal website. It's my opinion that these heavy handed frameworks are
complex for the simple, static website and introduce a lot of overhead to the build process.

This time, I've settled for a simple static website that is served using Express. For fun, I hooked in Gulp for task management
and use Sass/Babel for CSS and ES6 compiling.

The majority of the website was completed in the span of a day or two – but I'll be tweaking it here and there.
Since it's so lightweight, I expect that I'll be able to iterate through new website designs whenever I'm bored
quite quickly! :)
