        <h1>Hey there!</h1>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by. My name is JT, and I'm currently a Software Engineer at <b><a href="https://affirm.com" target="_blank">Affirm</a></b>, working on the <em>Risk Engineering</em> team.</p>
        
        <p>I graduated from the <b><a href="http://www.upenn.edu" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a></b> in May 2017 with a B.S.E. in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>A little about me: I live by the mantra: <em>"Learn as if you would live forever; live as if you would die tomorrow."</em>
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time, I like to longboard, read, learn songs on the guitar,
            and try new cooking recipes. Every now and then, I’ll also update my
            blog with various (often technical) musings. Check it out if you’d like!</p>
