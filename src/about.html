        <h1>Hey there!</h1>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by. My name is JT, and I’m currently a senior
            at the <b><a href="http://www.upenn.edu" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a></b> pursuing a
            B.S.E. in Computer Science. Post graduation, I will be moving to San Francisco to
            join <b><a href="https://affirm.com" target="_blank">Affirm, Inc.</a></b> as a Software Engineer.</p>
        <p>Everybody has some "thing" that keeps them going. If you were to ask me what drives my passions,
            I'd share the following.</p>
        <p><em>"Learn as if you would live forever; live as if you would die tomorrow."</em>
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time, I like to longboard, read, learn songs on the guitar,
            and try new cooking recipes. Every now and then, I’ll also update my
            blog with various (often technical) musings. Check it out if you’d like!</p>
